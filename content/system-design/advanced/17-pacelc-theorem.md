## Background

We cannot avoid partition in a distributed system, therefore, according to the CAP theorem, a distributed system should choose between consistency or availability. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) databases chose consistency (refuse response if it cannot check with peers), while BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent) databases chose availability (respond with local data without ensuring it is the latest with its peers). One place where the CAP theorem is silent is what happens when there is no network partition? What choices does a distributed system have when there is no partition?

## Definition

The PACELC theorem states that in a system that replicates data:

- if there is a partition (‘P’), a distributed system can tradeoff between availability and consistency (i.e., ‘A’ and ‘C’);
- else (‘E’), when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, the system can tradeoff between latency (‘L’) and consistency (‘C’).

## Solution

The first part of the theorem (PAC) is the same as the CAP theorem, and the ELC is the extension. The whole thesis is assuming we maintain high availability by replication. So, when there is a failure, CAP theorem prevails. But if not, we still have to consider the tradeoff between consistency and latency of a replicated system.

## Examples

- **Dynamo and Cassandra** are PA/EL systems: They choose availability over consistency when a partition occurs; otherwise, they choose lower latency.
- **BigTable and HBase** are PC/EC systems: They will always choose consistency, giving up availability and lower latency.
- **MongoDB** is PA/EC: In case of a network partition, it chooses availability, but otherwise guarantees consistency.
